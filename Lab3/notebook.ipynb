    "First download the python modules required for today’s session from Learn (NLOLab3.zip) and unpack them. Some of the files have the same name as in the previous lab session (week 3) but extended functionality. Please work with the new versions. For most of this session we keep working with the files `GenericLineSearchMethod.py` and `LineSearchPlot.py` as in the previous lab session (week 3).\n",

    "In the previous lab session we have optimized various functions by line search methods based on coordinate descent and steepest descent. Let’s see if using the conjugate gradient method improves things. First try the Fletcher-Reeves variant of the CG method with exact line searches on the `ex21` problem. Go back to where the previous lab session has ended to solve the Ex21 problem with the conjugate\n",
