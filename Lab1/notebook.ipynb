Note that for this to work the expression `X**2` must be interpreted as being applied componentwise, which is indeed what Python (or more specifically `numpy`) does. It is also worth noting that for matrices $A$, $B$ represented as `np.arrays` the expression `A*B` denotes componentwise multiplication, not the usual matrix-matrix product. That would be obtained by `np.matmul(A, B)`."
