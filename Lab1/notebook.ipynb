So please make sure you work through the _whole_ of this lab sheet. Finish in your own time if you cannot do so in the lab session itself.\n",

    "For the lab sessions of NLO we will be making use of Python. I assume that you use Visual Studio Code for your Python programming, but you are free to use whatever setup you like.\n",

    "If you are planning to use VS Code, then you need to install it on the lab computers (in your personal space). You should only need to do this once. For this search for \"Visual Studio Code\" and follow the links to install it. Once it is installed, open it and install the \"Python\" and \"Jupyter Notebook\" extensions. You should be ready to go then.\n",

Since many of the arguments in nonlinear optimization are essentially geometrical it helps to be able to visualise functions. This first part of the lab is mainly concerned with showing you how to do that using\n",

A _figure_ may contain several _axes_ (but we will usually only use one).\n",

There are a few functions in matplotlib that enable us to do this. Try the following piece of code"

This is a trick that allows the calculation of the function $z(x, y) = x^2 + y^2$ by the short notation `Z = X**2 + Y**2`. Note that for this to work the expression `X**2` must be interpreted as being applied componentwise, which is indeed what python (or more specifically `numpy`) does. Finally for a 3-d plot we must tell matplotlib explicitly to create axes to represent 3D data (think of it as a coordinate system with $x$, $y$, $z$ axes).\n",

    "In Jupyter, we can use `ax.view init(elev=50, azim=45)` immediately after the `plot_surface` command to change the orientation of the plot: `elev` gives the angle above the $xy$-plane from which you look and `azim` the direction (both in degrees).  To change the appearance of the plot, you may wish to add the option `cmap=plt.get_cmap('hsv')`. Also try the effect of or `ax.plot_wireframe` instead of `ax.plot_surface`.\n",

To overcome this we use a pre-coded function module. We will use this approach quite frequently in the labs so here is a brief tutorial. The function from Ex 1.3 is coded up in a python module named `ex13func.py`. The actual function defined in that file is called `ex13`. Let's import that by doing"
